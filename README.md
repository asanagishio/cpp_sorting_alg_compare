# cpp_sorting_alg_compare
embarcadero c++ builder project: Performance Evaluation for Sorting Algorithms

How to use: Open and compile Project1.cbproj with embarcadero c++ builder

Usage: Generate n variables within a range and perform sorting, 
meanwhile return an execution time for each selected sorting method.

Implemented sorting algorithm: 
 (1). Selection sort   (2). Insertion sort   (3). Bubble sort
 (4). Quick sort (recursive versions)
 (5). Quick sort (non-recursive versions)
 (6). Merge sort (recursive versions)
 (7). Merge sort (non-recursive versions)
 (8). Heap sort
 (9). Radix sort
